# Cleaned_Real_Estate_Sales_2001-2022_GL.csvv2 â€” Real Estate Price Prediction Portfolio

This project presents a full machine learning pipeline applied to a real-world real estate dataset. The goal was to clean, explore, and build a predictive model to estimate property sale prices based on historical housing data from 2001 to 2022.

## Key Highlights

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Removed outliers and duplicate records.
- Fixed inconsistent formats in dates and numerical fields.
- Converted categorical variables and optimized memory usage.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized sale trends over years, property types, and towns.
- Identified key variables impacting price (e.g., size, location, year).

### 3. **Modeling**
- Trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Evaluated models using RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Selected the **Random Forest Regressor** for best performance.

### 4. **Export & Deployment**
- Exported trained model for reuse.
- All artifacts uploaded to GitHub for documentation and accessibility.

## Model Performance

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor  
- **RÂ² Score**: ~0.92  
- **MSE**: ~1.47e+07
